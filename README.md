## By: Vadhna Samedy Hun

🤖 **Course**: IBM Supervised Machine Learning Classification (Coursera)  
🛠 **Skills Learned**: Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, and more

## 📌 Project Description

This repository contains my work from the IBM Supervised Machine Learning Classification Course on Coursera. Throughout this course, I gained hands-on experience with various classification algorithms and evaluation techniques, including:

- Binary and multi-class classification methods
- Model selection and hyperparameter tuning
- Performance evaluation metrics
- Model interpretation techniques
- Handling unbalanced classes

Each module explores different classification algorithms with practical implementations and real-world datasets.
